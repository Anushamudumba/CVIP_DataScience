# CVIP_DataScience Internship Project Repository
Phase-1:

// Normal Task - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism
In this task, I have performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset related to terrorism. The aim was to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and factors associated with terrorism incidents. The analysis included data visualization, statistical summaries, and identifying correlations between different variables.

// Golden Task - Breast Cancer Prediction
For the golden task of Phase 1, I have worked on a breast cancer prediction project. Using machine learning techniques, I  have built a predictive model to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of features. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

Phase-2:

//Normal Task -Email Spam Detection
Email Filtering: One of the primary methods for spam mail detection is email filtering. It involves categorize incoming emails into spam and non-spam. Machine learning algorithms can be trained to filter out spam mails based on their content and metadata.And the Natural Language Processing,Text Classification,Feature Engineering,Supervised Learning,Unsupervised Learning are also used in Email Spam Detection.

//Golden Task- Speech Emotion Recognition
I am going to build a speech emotion detection classifier.
But first we need to learn about what is speech recognition (SER) and why are we building this project? Well, few of the reasons are-
First, lets define SER i.e. Speech Emotion Recognition.
Speech Emotion Recognition, abbreviated as SER, is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech. This is also the phenomenon that animals like dogs and horses employ to be able to understand human emotion.

Emotion recognition is the part of speech recognition which is gaining more popularity and need for it increases enormously. 
SER(Speech Emotion Recognition) is used in call center for classifying calls according to emotions and can be used as the performance parameter for conversational analysis thus identifying the unsatisfied customer, customer satisfaction and so on.. for helping companies improving their services

Datasets used in this project

* Crowd-sourced Emotional Mutimodal Actors Dataset (Crema-D)
* Ryerson Audio-Visual Database of Emotional Speech and Song (Ravdess)
* Surrey Audio-Visual Expressed Emotion (Savee)
* Toronto emotional speech set (Tess)
