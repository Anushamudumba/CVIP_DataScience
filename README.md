Phase-1:

// Normal Task - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Terrorism
In this task, I have performed exploratory data analysis on a dataset related to terrorism. The aim was to gain insights into the patterns, trends, and factors associated with terrorism incidents. The analysis included data visualization, statistical summaries, and identifying correlations between different variables.

// Golden Task - Breast Cancer Prediction
For the golden task of Phase 1, I have worked on a breast cancer prediction project. Using machine learning techniques, I  have built a predictive model to classify breast cancer cases as benign or malignant based on a set of features. The model's performance was evaluated using various metrics to ensure its accuracy and reliability.
